**Saint Cyr is one of the six military schools in France. To be admitted at Saint Cyr, you have to be a child of military, civil servant, or a scholarship student. It is a boarding school. Many famous people studied in this school such as De Gaulle, Jean Leclerc, Lyautey and Tom Morel.**

**The story of St Cyr started to 300 years ago**, in 1686, where the Marquise of Maintenont decided to build a school for nobleâ€™s daughter. It became a military school for military officers under Napoleon and was destroyed 1943. In 1966, De Gaulle decided to rebuild the ruin and to found the College Militaire of St Cyr.

**But St Cyr is a very demanding school**. This excellence cost a lot: your time, to leave your family for a moment, to be always prepared to hardworking, to never stop,...Students are often tired, and they look forward to the holidays.

**Boarding can be repellent**. This system of life is drastic and different of what we have known at home. Studies are sometimes complicated because all students work and make noises. Furthermore, it breaks your habit and makes you uncomfortable at beginning.

**If you dislike military management**, it is not a school for you. It's all the interest of this school. It is so important that override it. During the year, students have to do ceremony and some needs to stay Friday evening because it happens Saturday.
