description: Is China going too far in AI development ?
---
 China is likely to remain the most developed country in the field of artificial intelligence. As a remarkable fact in China, AI, is used everywhere such as in the streets with security cameras and face recognition, or even in the established school system with many gadgets which track students activity and attention level.

 Indeed, students are kept an eye on by chips that track their location and even more cameras that check if they’re sleeping or being attentive to their class. But it doesn’t stop there, China invested billions of dollars in able headbands to determine if a pupil is focus or considered not. The data collected from students’ brainwaves is then sent to the teacher’s computer to generate a report of class’ average attention level over time. Teachers can on top see student's specific report which is sent to parents too.

 However, all theses chips and cameras put many excessive pressures on top of the students. Indeed, we have been talking to a student whose parents punished him for bad attention score. Which may be controversial since just as Theodore Zanto, a neuroscientist at the University of San Francisco said, this technology isn’t really reliable since recently little research have been made. Additionally, the headbands are put by pupils themselves. What he suggests is that if setup in an imperfect way, the chip might produce inaccurate readings which will be reflected in students’ scores. 

 With this incredible development of AI in Chinese school one may wonder if one day all this pressure put on top of students will increase the rate of depression and suicide in China.
